## Project Description  
Design a low-cost automated pet feeder system that can:  
- Dispense food for cats and dogs at scheduled times  
- Monitor food consumption  
- Alert staff if any issues occur, such as:  
  - No food is dispensed  
  - Food is not eaten by the animal  


## Assumptions  
- One feeder serves one animal at a time  
- For indoor use only  
- Availability of power supply  
- Staff checks alerts regularly  
- Pet should eat within 10 minutes after dispensing; otherwise, an alert is raised
